# Power-BI-Project
This Power BI project was developed as part of the Analyzing and Visualizing Data module. The dataset used comes from Olist, the largest department store on Brazilian marketplaces. For this project, I chose to create a Payments and Financial Dashboard to explore and analyze the financial aspects of the business.
